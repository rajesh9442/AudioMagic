# AudioMagic

AudioMagic is a full-stack audio processing application that offers an innovative way to transform audio content. The project is split into two main components:

## Backend
The backend is built with FastAPI and is responsible for:
- **Audio Processing:** Separating vocals from instruments using advanced models.
- **Creative Transformations:** Generating "Cat Version" tracks by replacing vocals with cat sounds.
- **Flexible Inputs:** Supporting audio file uploads and processing audio content from YouTube links.

## Frontend
The frontend is a sleek and interactive interface developed with React and Vite. It enables users to:
- **Upload & Preview:** Easily upload audio files and preview the processed results.
- **Monitor Processing:** Track the status of the audio transformation in real time.
- **Download Results:** Seamlessly download the final processed audio tracks.
